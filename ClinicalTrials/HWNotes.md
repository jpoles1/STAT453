####Bayesian Optimal Interval Design: A Simple and Well-Performing Design for Phase I Oncology Trials

- 3+3 design is a classic approach to Phase 1 trials, however many newer and more inovative algorithms are available
- This paper presents the Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) algorithm
- "BOIN design contains the 3 + 3 design and the accelerated titration design as special cases"
