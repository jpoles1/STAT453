#STAT 453 - Clinical Trial Notes
###By: Jordan Poles

##Bayesian Statistics

####Bayes Rule

$$
P(E|D) = \frac{P(D|E) P(E)}{P(D)}
$$

####Updating Estimates



##Clinical Trials

- A clinical trial is a prospective study evaluating the effect of interventions on humans under pre-specified conditions.
- A **controlled trial** is a prospective study comparing the effect of intervention against a control group.
- **Adaptive clinical trials** are characterized by updating of our statistical model for each patient, in order to monitor/ensure safety.

####Clinical Trial Phases

1) Pilot Study (n<18), though not always necessary
2) Phase 1 - Clinical pharmacology and toxicity (20 < n < 40)
  - Determine Max Tolerated Dose (MTD); Optimal Biological Dose (OBD); and Recommended Phase II dose (RP2D)
3) Phase 2 - Initial assessment of efficacy (30 < n < 100)
4) Phase 3 -Full-scale evaluation of treatment efficacy (100 < n)
5) Postmarking Surveillance

_Primary prevention trials = preventing a disease using a long term treatment (n > 10,000)_

####Picking a Primary Objective

- Define one question the investigators are most interested in answering and capable of adequately answering
- Define the primary endpoints
  - Toxicity (as in phase 1), efficacy (response/survival), quality of life (QOL)
- Define type of study
   - Hypothesis testing or esimation (typical)
   - Superirority or equivalence to other treatments/standards
 - Sample size

####Secondary Objectives

- Different endpoints
- Subgroup Hypothesis
  - PRospectively defined
  - Based on reasonable expectations
  - Limited in number
- Hypothesis testing vs generation
- Hunting vs fishing expedition
  - You want to go in with a hypothesis, not go fishing for a positive result.

####Response variables
- Question should be defined prospectively and specifically
- Primary response variable should be assessable in all patients, and unbiased/objective
- Participation typically occurs when primary response var occurs
