##Question 1
_Use a stoping size equal to cohort size!_

_Create your own  toxicity scenarios._
####Part 1

Here, I simulate the operating characteristics of a BOIN trial design given 5 different meaningful toxicity scenarios of my own design. I decided to take a slightly novel approach, and use procedural generation to describe several different toxicity scenarios using simple multivariate equations.

I've created a set of functions in R which make it simple to functionally compose a toxicity scenario using any bivariate equation (the results of which are automatically scaled from 0-1), and receive back both a plot of the toxicity scenario in 3D as well as a set of data points (a toxicity level for each level of treatment) which may be input directly into the BOIN R/GUI software in order to discretely simulate the scenario with a given set of drug concentrations. Additionally, the levels for each of the two drugs in question may be set, such that one increase in dosage is not necessarily as significant as a larger increase (or the relationship could be linear for each dosage step).

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(BOIN)
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
library(plot3D)
f1 = function(i){(i["x"]+i["y"])}
f2 = function(i){(i["x"]+i["y"]**2)}
f3 = function(i){((i["x"])**2+(.2*i["y"]))}
f4 = function(i){((i["x"])**4*(i["y"])**3)}
f5 = function(i){((i["x"]-5)**3+(i["y"]-1)**3)}
plot_sim = function(fn, maxtox, name="fn", output=0){
  side = seq(1,4,.1)
  #side = c(1:4)
  siderange = c(min(side), max(side))
  xy = as.vector(expand.grid(side, side))
  colnames(xy) = c("x", "y")
  z = apply(xy, 1, fn)
  #scale 0 to 1
  z = scale(z, center = min(z), scale = max(z)-min(z))*maxtox
  ds = cbind(xy, z)
  z = matrix(z, ncol=length(side), byrow=TRUE)
  #p = plot_ly(z=~z) %>% add_surface() %>% layout(title=paste('Plot of', name))
  #p = ggplot(data=ds, aes(x=x, y=y, z=z))+geom_contour()
  if(output){
    persp3D(side, side, z, xlab="Gemcitabine Lvl", ylab="MK-8776 Lvl", main = paste('Plot of', name), zlim=c(0, 1))
  }
  return(ds)
}
side = c(1:4)
scenario_sim = function(fn, maxtox, xside=side, yside=side, output=0){
  xside = scale(xside, center = min(xside), scale = max(xside)-min(xside))
  yside = scale(yside, center = min(yside), scale = max(yside)-min(yside))
  xy = as.vector(expand.grid(xside, yside))
  colnames(xy) = c("x", "y")
  z = apply(xy, 1, fn)
  #scale 0 to 1
  z = scale(z, center = min(z), scale = max(z)-min(z))*maxtox
  ds = cbind(xy, z)
  z = matrix(z, ncol=length(yside), byrow=TRUE)
  if(output){
    persp(xside, yside, z, xlab="Gemcitabine Lvl", ylab="MK-8776 Lvl", zlim=c(0, 1))
  }
  return(z)
}
sims = c(f1, f2, f3, f4, f5)
names = c("f1", "f2", "f3", "f4", "f5")
outcomes = c()
scenarios = c()
for(i in seq_along(sims)){
  sim = sims[[i]]
  sim_name = names[i]
  outcome = plot_sim(sim, 1, sim_name, output=0)
  scenario = scenario_sim(sim, 1)
  scenarios = append(scenarios, list(scenario))
  outcomes = rbind(outcomes, cbind(outcome, i))
}
```

A summary of our different toxicity scenarios:
```{r}
xside=c(400, 600, 800, 1000)
yside = c(20,40,80,112) 
ggplot(data=outcomes, aes(x=x,y=y,z=z, colour=..level..))+geom_contour()+facet_wrap(~i)

```

I find that the interpreting the goodness of the MTD Operating Characteristics for a given scenario was rather cumbersome, given the available matrices and metrics. Thus I propose a novel metric, which maximizes the nearness to 

$$
  \sum{(DLT_d - i)^2/}
$$

1) A linear relationship with both drugs. Maxmimum toxicity when both drugs are at maximum. Here, and in the following scenarios, we assume that dosage levels are set such that 100% toxicity never occurs (we estimate max 80% toxicity).
```{r}
f1
maxtox=.6
ds = plot_sim(f1, maxtox, "f1", 1)
scenario_sim(f1, maxtox, xside, yside, 1)
```

2) A linear relationship with Gemcitabine; quadratic growth with MK-8776 level. Maxmimum toxicity when both drugs are at maximum.
```{r}
f2
ds = plot_sim(f2, maxtox, "f2", output=1)
scenario_sim(f2, maxtox, xside, yside, 1)
```

3) In this scenario, there is little change in toxicity as Gemcitabine level increases, while the second drug causes much greater toxicity at high levels
```{r}
f3
ds = plot_sim(f3, maxtox, "f3", output=1)
scenario_sim(f3, maxtox, xside, yside, 1)
```

4) In this scenario, there is a dramatic increase in toxicity at the highest levels of dosage. I introduce a slight asymetry, such that toxicty of Gemcitabine increases more rapidly, but at higher doses.
```{r}
f4
ds = plot_sim(f4, .45, "f4", output=1)
scenario_sim(f4, .45, xside, yside, 1)
```

5)A complex underlying toxicity function, which models what may be a more realistic dose/toxicity curve
```{r}
f5 = function(i){((i["x"]-3)**3+(i["y"]-1)**3)-(2*i["x"]*i["y"])}
ds = plot_sim(f5, maxtox, "f5", output=1)
scenario_sim(f5, 1, xside, yside, 1)
```

```{r}
get.oc.comb(.3, scenario_sim(f1, maxtox, xside, yside, 0), 42, 3, n.earlystop=42, startdose=c(1, 1), ntrial=1000, MTD.contour=FALSE)
get.oc.comb(.3, scenario_sim(f2, maxtox, xside, yside, 0), 42, 3, n.earlystop=42, startdose=c(1, 1), ntrial=1000, MTD.contour=FALSE)
get.oc.comb(.3, scenario_sim(f3, maxtox, xside, yside, 0), 42, 3, n.earlystop=42, startdose=c(1, 1), ntrial=1000, MTD.contour=FALSE)
get.oc.comb(.3, scenario_sim(f4, .45, xside, yside, 0), 42, 3, n.earlystop=42, startdose=c(1, 1), ntrial=1000, MTD.contour=FALSE)
get.oc.comb(.3, scenario_sim(f5, maxtox, xside, yside, 0), 42, 3, n.earlystop=42, startdose=c(1, 1), ntrial=1000, MTD.contour=FALSE)
```

A major shortcoming of the software, which became apparent during the aforementioned analysis, was the inability to easily extract the selection percentage matrix.

####Part 2

Here I create two realistic phase 1 clinical trial scenarios in order to test the functionality of the BOIN algorithm and software for the purpose of finding a single MTD. I utilize a sample size of 42, with a cohort size of 3 for each of the two trials.

For my first trial, I had envisioned a simple scenario for the toxicity matrix, but the software exhibited some strange behaviour, such that it only ended up exploring the dosage combinations for a single drug (Gemcitabine), without investigating any of the toxicity characteristics of the second. Thus, I do not believe it found a reasonable MTD.

In my second trial, the search proceeded normally, and produced a more complete toxicity matrix as would be expected. The algorithm was also able to find a reasonable choice for the MTD in this scenario. Thus it performed significantly stronger in this case as compared to the first trial.

##Question 2

####Part 2

In this trial, the algorithm performed a very thourough search of the toxicity matrix, and it appears to have used the available subjects for each subtrial effectively. It seems that the chosen MTDs are very reasonable given the hypothetical trial scenario.

In this trial, the early-stopping mechanism of the design kicked-in. I was surprised that the remainder of the trials were not used, given that the algorithm did not explore at least one notable dosage combination: (2,2). Nonetheless, the chosen MTD values are not unreasonable, though they may not permit maximum efficacy.

##Question 3
- You should be able to assign a drug quanity for each dosage level.
- You should be able to import/export curves as a CSV list.
